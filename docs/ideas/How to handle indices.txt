How to handle indices?
======================

### Unique indices

* PRIMARY KEY
* CREATE INDEX UNIQUE

### Non-unique indices
* FOREIGN KEY - right part
* CREATE INDEX
* JOIN and WHERE optimization

Moments
==
* Creation
  CREATE DATABASE + PRIMARY KEY + FOREIGN KEY
  CREATE CONSTRAINT
  CREARE INDEX (UNIQUE)
  SELECT OPTIMIZATION (if not exists)

* Broke
  Direct change data
  Transaction rollback
  Restore table

* Modify (record by record)
  Insert
  Update
  Delete

* Check availability and ReIndex
  Select optimization (preIndexation)
  Insert/Delete/Update

Question?
==
* Indices on demand (only when need)
* Prebuilt indexes

TRANSACTIONS
