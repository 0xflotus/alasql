How to modify the parser (assuming your in Windows XP, Windows 7):

1.) install node.js

download the right installer/package for your system @ http://nodejs.org/download/
after successful installation the "npm" command is available in the command line. check by typing in command line the command below:

npm help

Note:
If the following error is encountered: "Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\npm'"
most likely the said path is missing. So you have to manually create it

2.) install jison

type in command line:

npm install -g jison

3. install CoffeeScript

type in command line:

npm install -g coffee-script

4.)
Add the below system/environment variable.

Variable Name   Value

NODE_PATH      C:\Users\migue-eugim.HPI\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
PATH               C:\Users\migue-eugim.HPI\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
restart machine

Also, make sure the directory C:\Users\migue-eugim.HPI\AppData\Roaming\npm is added to Path user variable.
The *.cmd files in that directory are used when doing a build.


5.)
Use coffee.cmd in Cakefile

Open D:\eugim\DOTNET_PROJECTS\CRC\POCKET_TRACKER_SURVEY_HTML5\js-sql\Cakefile

and in line  5

change from:
proc =         spawn 'coffee', args

to:
proc =         spawn 'coffee.cmd', args


6.)

In
D:\eugim\DOTNET_PROJECTS\CRC\POCKET_TRACKER_SURVEY_HTML5\js-sql\src\
modify any of the ff files:
grammar.coffee
lexer.coffee
nodes.coffee


7.)
Go to the current directory of the CakeFile (e.g. D:\eugim\DOTNET_PROJECTS\CRC\POCKET_TRACKER_SURVEY_HTML5\js-sql\)
in the command line, and type the below command:

cake build
